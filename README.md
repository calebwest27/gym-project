For the final project in my Python class of my freshman year, me and my partner Joel created two Python files to manage a gym management system.
The setup saves 'rb' files and stores data, and can pull them from memory. Many 'if' statements and lists are used to work the system effectively.
There are a handful of dangers involved in the project, such as not hiding private information the user can enter.
However, since this was just our very first semester, we hadn't yet learned how to hide those details.
Overall, the project enabled us to experiment with many new beginner concepts and offered us a mild level of expertise in Python coding.
